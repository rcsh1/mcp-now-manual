MCP Now is a desktop application that simplifies the management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations. As a local proxy service, it bridges AI applications (MCP Hosts like Cursor, Claude Desktop) with various MCP servers, serving as a central hub for MCP server discovery, configuration and management.


## General architecture

MCP Now acts as a local proxy service between the hosts and the servers. It provides a seamless way to switch between server for different use cases.

- **Hosts**: AI applications that connect to MCP servers.
- **Servers**: MCP servers. You can create multiple server instances of the same server, one for development and one for production.
- **Profile**: A collection of server that can be assigned to a host.

When operational, MCP Now:

1. Assigns a connection endpoint to each host  
2. Mounts the chosen profile to the host's endpoint  
3. Routes all incoming requests to the appropriate server instance runtimes  
4. Each server instance runtime connects to the corresponding data source or remote service


## Features

Managing MCP configurations for multiple AI applications can be challenging:

- Redundant configuration work when the same server needs to be set up across multiple hosts  
- Manual configuration changes are needed for different use cases and environments

MCP Now simplifies MCP configuration management by providing:

- Centralized discovery, installation, and management of MCP servers  
- Support for multiple instances of the same server with different configurations  
- Profile-based instance switching for easy context switching  
- An intuitive interface for monitoring connections and server status
